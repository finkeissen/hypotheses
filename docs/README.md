# Canonical governance docs

The canonical, binding governance documents live in **`research-program`**:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `EPISTEMIC_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `EPISTEMIC_HONESTY_CHARTER.md`
- `HARD_CORE.md`
- `SPIRAL_MODEL.md`
- `PROGRAM_FAILURE.md`
- `LEGACY_CHARTER.md`

This repository (hypotheses) contains **operational content only** and links to the canonical source of truth.
